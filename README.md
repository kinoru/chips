# [chips]

A plugin manager for [fish].

## Features

- (supposed to be) Fast. Compiled to the native machine code. Parallel installation/upgrade of plugins.
- Minimally invasive to your `config.fish`: Adding one line is sufficient.
- Minimum overhead to the fish shell itself. The amount of fish script to be loaded for chips to work is extremely little.
- Minimum installation cost: No dependency except `git` and `curl`. chips is a single statically-compiled binary executable file.
- Uninstallation is easy: Remove chips, `~/.config/chips`, and the line in `config.fish`, and you're clean as if you never installed chips at all.

### Advantages over fisherman

chips is not written by someone who abuses DMCA takedown to bully other free software projects. In fact, OMF getting shot down was the first motivation to write chips.

## Installation

Current version: **chips 1.0.0** (2016-04-01)

### GNU/Linux (x64)

Assuming `~/.local/bin` is in your `$PATH`:

```fish
curl -Lo ~/.local/bin/chips --create-dirs \
    https://github.com/kinoru/chips/releases/download/1.0.0/chips_linux_x64 \
    ; and chmod +x ~/.local/bin/chips
```

### OS X

Assuming `~/.local/bin` is in your `$PATH`:

```fish
curl -Lo ~/.local/bin/chips --create-dirs \
    https://github.com/kinoru/chips/releases/download/1.0.0/chips_osx \
    ; and chmod +x ~/.local/bin/chips
```

### Installation the hard way: Build from source

Use [Stack].

```fish
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/kinoru/chips
cd chips
stack install
```

## Usage

1. Run `chips`. This will create `~/.config/chips/plugin.yaml` with the default template.
1. Edit `plugin.yaml` to include your desired plugins. For example, consider [fish-sensible] or [shellder].
1. Run `chips; exec fish`.

After this, any time you make changes to `plugin.yaml` or want to update plugins, run `chips` again.

## Supported features

- Sourcing `init.fish` of plugins
- Installing themes: Plugins that contain `fish_prompt.fish` or `fish_right_prompt.fish`

## Coming soon

- Completely purging unused plugins
- Files under `functions` and `completions`
